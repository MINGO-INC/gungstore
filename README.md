# Gungstore

A Vite + React + TypeScript application with TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI components.

## Important: Cloud Storage Setup

**Question: "Does this save sales in the cloud so I can see them days later?"**

**Answer: YES, but you need to configure Supabase first!**

- **With Supabase:** Sales saved permanently in cloud, accessible from anywhere, multi-user real-time sync
- **Without Supabase:** Sales only saved in browser (temporary, single-user)

**See [CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md](CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step setup (5-10 minutes, free)**

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Supabase (RECOMMENDED for persistent cloud storage)

**Why you need this:**
- Sales data saved permanently (come back days/weeks/months later)
- Multiple users can see the same data in real-time
- Access from any device or browser
- Never lose data even if browser cache is cleared

The application uses Supabase to store order history permanently and enable real-time synchronization across multiple users. Without Supabase, orders will only be saved locally in the browser.

**Benefits of Supabase integration:**
- **Multi-user synchronization**: When one user adds an order, all other users see it in real-time
- **Persistent storage**: Orders are saved permanently in the cloud
- **Cross-device access**: Access the same order history from any device
- **Offline support**: App continues working offline, syncs when connection is restored

**For detailed step-by-step setup instructions, see [CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md](CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

**Quick Setup:**

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Add your Supabase credentials to `.env` (replace the placeholder values):
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```
   Tip: See the detailed explanation in [CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md - Step 3](CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md#step-3-configure-your-app)
   
4. **Create the database tables:**
   - **Quick Start:** Follow the [5-minute setup guide](supabase/QUICK_START.md)
   - **Detailed Instructions:** See [supabase/README.md](supabase/README.md) for complete documentation
   
   You'll create these tables:
   - `orders` - Order history (required)
   - `products` - 48 pre-loaded firearms and accessories (recommended)
   - `employees` - 5 staff members (recommended)
   - `inventory_transactions` - Stock tracking (optional)

**That's it!** Your sales are now saved in the cloud permanently.

**Note:** The app will work without Supabase configuration, but order history will only persist in browser localStorage (single-user, temporary storage).


## Development

Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

## Deployment

**IMPORTANT**: Always deploy the contents of the `dist` folder, not the source code.

### GitHub Pages

1. Build your application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your gh-pages branch
3. The repository includes configuration files in the `public` folder that will be copied to `dist` during build:
   - `.htaccess` - Ensures proper MIME types for Apache servers
   - `_headers` - Ensures proper MIME types for Netlify/Cloudflare Pages
   - `.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages
   - `404.html` - Handles client-side routing for SPAs (redirects all 404s to index.html)

### Other Static Hosts (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages)

1. Set build command: `npm run build`
2. Set publish directory: `dist`
3. The `_headers` file will configure proper MIME types automatically.

### Manual Deployment

If you're deploying to a custom server:
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder (not the `dist` folder itself) to your web server
3. Ensure your server is configured to:
   - Serve `.js` and `.mjs` files with `application/javascript` MIME type
   - Serve `.jsx` files with `text/javascript` MIME type
   - Route all requests to `index.html` for client-side routing

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors on GitHub Pages Routes

If you get a 404 error when navigating directly to routes like `/history` on GitHub Pages:
1. Ensure the `404.html` file from the `public` folder is included in your deployment
2. This file handles client-side routing by redirecting to `index.html` while preserving the route
3. The issue is automatically resolved by the included `404.html` file - just rebuild and redeploy

### MIME Type Errors

If you see errors like "was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type", ensure:
1. You're deploying the built `dist` folder, not the source code
2. Your server is serving JavaScript files with the correct MIME type
3. The `.htaccess` or `_headers` files from the build are being used by your server
